<doc-comment text="I was messing with various i18n frameworks and tools in combination with Astro, and must say that Paraglide was the smoothest experience. I have migrated my website from i18next and it was a breeze. SSG and SSR worked out of the box (which was the first one for me), and overall DX is great.

## Getting Started

First, set up [ParaglideJS](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs) with the Paraglide CLI. It will ask you:
- Which languages you want to use - The first one being the default (_can_ be changed later)
- Where to place the generated files (use the default)

```bash
npx @inlang/paraglide-js init
```

The CLI will generate a few files:

- `messages/{lang}.json` files where your will translations live.
- A `project.inlang` folder where you can configure your project.

Once that's done, install the Astro Integration and register it in `astro.config.mjs`. Also, set up Astro's i18n routing with the same languages.

```bash
npm i @inlang/paraglide-js-adapter-astro
```

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import paraglide from "@inlang/paraglide-js-adapter-astro"
import { languageTags, sourceLanguageTag } from "./project.inlang/settings.json"

export default {
	// Set up Astro i18n with the same languages as paraglide
	// This is a shorthand way to configure all languages. You can also pass the locales manually & use features like `paths`.
	i18n: {
		locales: languageTags,
		defaultLocale: sourceLanguageTag,
	},

	integrations: [
		// recommended settings
		paraglide({
			project: "./project.inlang",
			outdir: "./src/paraglide", //where your files should be
		}),
	],
}
```

You're now ready to start using Paraglide.

## Usage

### Adding & using messages

Translations live in `messages/{lang}.json` files. Add a message in there to get started

```json
// messages.en.json
{
	"hello": "Hello {name}!"
}
```

In code you can use the messages by importing from `src/paraglide/messages.js`. This file is generated by the compiler

```astro
---
import * as m from "../paraglide/messages.js";
---

<h1>{m.hello({ name: "Samuel" })}</h1>
```

Vite can tree-shake the messages with no extra work from you. Only messages that are used on an Island will be included in the client bundle, drastically reducing the bundle size.

### Configuring Languages

You can configure which languages you support in `project.inlang/settings.json`.

```json
{
	"languageTags": ["en", "de"],
	"sourceLanguageTag": "en"
}
```

If you add a new language, simply add another `{newLang}.json` file in the `messages/` folder.

### How Language Detection Works

The Integration relies on [`astro:i18n`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/internationalization/)'s language detection.

If you place your page in a folder named for the language all messages will be in that language. 

```filesystem
src
â”œâ”€â”€ pages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ en
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ about.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ de
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ about.astro
```

If a page isn't in a language folder the default language is used.

```filesystem
src
â”œâ”€â”€ pages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro // default language
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ about.astro // default language
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ de
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro // de
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ about.astro // de
```

### Passing the Language to the Client

To save bundle size the integration doesn't ship language detection code to the client. Instead, it will read the `lang` attribute on the `<html>` tag. Make sure it is set correctly.

```astro
//src/layouts/default.astro
---
import { languageTag } from "$paraglide/runtime";
---

<!doctype html>
<html lang={languageTag()} dir={Astro.locals.paraglide.dir}>
    <slot />
</html>
---
```

You can access the current language and text direction via `Astro.locals.paraglide.lang` and `Astro.locals.paraglide.dir` respectively.

### Linking between pages

### Adding Alternate Links

For SEO reasons, you should add alternate links to your page's head that point to all translations of the current page. Also include the _current_ page.

```html
<head>
	<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="/en/about" />
	<link rel="alternate" hreflang="de" href="/de/ueber-uns" />
</head>
```

Since only you know which pages correspond to each other this can't reliably be done automatically. Add these links manually.
